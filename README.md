# merelybot
merely is a bot that exists mostly to serve my own needs on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/f6TnEJM), however it also has some unique and complex commands that people on other servers seem to enjoy.

I categorise my commands based on their purpose. For interactive tutorials on how to use these commands, please refer to the [web UI](https://merely.yiays.com).

# contributing
feel free to fix any bugs or add new features to a fork, and send me a pull request, pretty standard github stuff.

## executing
to run the bot in your own environment, install the requirements in requirements.txt, and create an environment variable with the name Merely and the value being a Discord Bot Token, and disable the meme module (a method to do this is being implemented).
