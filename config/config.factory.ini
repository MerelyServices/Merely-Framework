	- Please refer to [this website](https://github.com/MerelyServices/Merely-Framework/blob/0.x/merely_data/changes.md) for older changelogs.
	> 1.0.0
	- Rewritten to be a modular bot framework which other bots can be built atop of. (merelybot is an example implementation of merely)
	- In the spirit of being modular, all stock modules handle dependencies between other modules gracefully and warn the server whenever required modules are missing.
	- Removed the following commands: `command, hint, stats, echo, blacklist, whitelist, censor`.
	- `clean` and `purge` are now one command with a new syntax.
	- Entirely removed censor module
	- Renamed several commands and reduced aliases
	- Added translation support
	- Added autosharding support
	- Added an experimental commandless module, use m/lighbulb enable to try it on your server.
	- All settings are now stored in one config file, and config history is recorded for safe-keeping.
	- When creating a bot using merelyframework, the bot can be renamed, the prefix changed, and custom help and info commands can be written all within the config file.
	> 1.1.0
	- Migrated from Discord.py to Disnake - enabling this bot to start taking advantage of recent Discord features like slash commands and threads.
	> 1.2.0
	- Moved all commands to slash commands - some modules, like music, meme, and lightbulb, didn't make it.
	- Countless performance and usability improvements due to the slash commands rewrite.
	- Language preferences can now be automatically detected by babel based on you and your server's Discord preferences.
	- New extension in preview: EventMsg - a server automation toolkit. This will eventually replace welcome, farewell, and reactrole.
	- Commands now have default permissions, this means admin and mod commands are hidden from regular users in the slash commands menu.
	> 1.2.1
	- Added `/controlpanel` - Allows admins to tweak settings for their server without adding a bunch more slash commands.
